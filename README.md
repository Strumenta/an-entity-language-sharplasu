# Symbol Resolution and Type Calculation With a Entity Language

This project shows how to add semantic enrichment to a parser based on the [Sharplasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/sharplasu) library:
- how to perform symbol resolution
- how to calculate types of expressions

It works on a simple language, but uses common patterns for symbol resolution.

This is the companion repository of the article [Resolve Symbols and Calculate Types with Sharplasu](https://tomassetti.me/resolve-symbols-and-calculate-types-with-sharplasu/).
